  <h1>BitDrive and BitDrive GUI</h1>

  <h2>BitDrive</h2>

  <p>BitDrive is a Python application that provides secure file encryption and decryption using the Fernet encryption algorithm. It uses PBKDF2 to derive a key from the user's password and stores the salt and key in files in the BitDrive Locker folder. The application prompts the user to enter a new password if the password file does not exist.</p>

  <p>To run the application, navigate to the directory containing the Python file and run it using a Python interpreter. The application will prompt the user to choose an option: encrypt or decrypt the E:\ drive. The application will exclude critical or system files from the encryption or decryption process.</p>

  <h2>BitDrive GUI</h2>

  <p>BitDrive GUI is a graphical user interface for BitDrive. It provides a user-friendly way to encrypt and decrypt files using BitDrive. The application uses Tkinter to create a window with a password entry widget and a submit button. When the user submits a password, the application derives a key from the password using PBKDF2 and stores the salt and key in files in the BitDrive Locker folder. The application then creates another window with buttons to encrypt or decrypt the E:\ drive. The buttons are bound to functions that perform the encryption or decryption process.</p>

  <p>To run the application, navigate to the directory containing the Python file and run it using a Python interpreter. The application will display a window with a password entry widget and a submit button. After the user submits a password, the application will display another window with buttons to encrypt or decrypt the E:\ drive.</p>
